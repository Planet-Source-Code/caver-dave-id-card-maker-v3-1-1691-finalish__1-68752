Title:- ID_Card_Maker v3.1.1691 - Finalish!

Update 19/06/07:- Ok maybe, possibly not quite FINAL! now with added webcam support got the idea from a friend that works in a western union office and they use a webcam to capture an ID Card picture and create the card there and then.
                            NOW THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE APP OF ITS TYPE ON PSC!
To Do:- Update help and add instant card printing back and front on the same sheet for both landscape and portrait card formats
===========================================================================
Update 16/06/07:- FINAL - Changed from using gradients created a runtime to a set of preset backgrounds, all placed in the resource file (it is now 8.8mb). Refined the print and print preview screen now clears all card images on the change over from 3up to 4up and vice versa and added a clear all and reset button. You can now go from the main design screen straight to the print and print preview screen without going via the card preview.
Unless any major bugs and errors are found this project is now complete?? the only thing left to do is an updated screen shot and revise and complete the help.
===========================================================================
Update 15/06/07:- Added change the card orientation, basic vertical gradient backgrounds(experimental), shortcut dialogue to place icon etc on the desktop. Tidied up the basic text editing, made the program more advanced while keeping the simple user operation and functionality. May be some bugs - if you find any please let me know.
===========================================================================
Update 11/06/07:- Added help screens for each of the 3 program screens. Added some basic error
handling to make things run a bit more smoothly and tidied up the UI to make it easier to understand without having to resort to the help and made sure the check file is included!!

New screen shot next time
===========================================================================
Update: NOW IT DOES PRINT!!

Identity card maker that can easily be adapted to be used for business cards.

Designed to be used with the jpg image format that is the common standard with most digital cameras.
Saves the cards in the bmp image format. 
The application also has the capability to save the card preview as a jpg for use as a template, so that your basic design features can be reused and then added to the design window as a background an then the extra image and text added.

The application uses the  Intel® JPEG Library dll - ijl11.dll this is included in the submission as a custom resource '101' and is manually extracted to the app folder.

Normally I do not use external libraries but this one is used to make up for my lack of graphics knowledge!
As most compiled resources are stripped out by psc using the res file avoids this and assures the user of its availability - QED!

Credits:

Image resizing using grab handles(nodes) from an author on psc - forgotten your name- sorry
Intel® JPEG Library dll and code from vbaccelarator
Miscellaneous bits from msdn / technet
All icons and cursors produced or updated with Robert Rayments Tiny GFX
Webcam support using butchered and adapted  form / module / class from Mohammed Samir Fayed's VB WebCam Capture

Finally:- when I produced this originally it did not need a printing routine, this has been added for the psc submission
However my printer died this morning and i have not been able to test the printing - IF IT DOES NOT WORK please let me know just as if it does  Thanks dave

Bend, Break, Reuse this code as you like but if you do use it give some credit and vote
